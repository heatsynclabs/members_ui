## Code of Conduct

HeatSync Labs has a
[Code of Conduct](http://wiki.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Bylaws#CODE_OF_CONDUCT)
to which all community members and contributors must adhere.

## Issues

* Please use the Issues Templates to effectively communicate your desired changes.
  Also feel free to implement the changes yourself and ask questions in order to do so!

## Pull Requests

* First, check the [README](README.md) for install instructions. Also check [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for names of people involved in the project.
* Second, communicate in our [Slack](https://heatsynclabs.slack.com/) (#hslapi channel) to make sure nobody has any objections to or feedback
  about your planned contributions -- we're a do-ocracy, but we also don't want to waste anyone's time or introduce unneeded chaos!
* Finally, use Github's features to create a fork of the reposistory under your username, submit your committed changes to a branch there,
  and then open a pull request on the HSL project. Use the PR template provided to let project maintainers know what your changes do and how to test them.
